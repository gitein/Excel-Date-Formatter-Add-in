# ðŸš¸ Limitations and specifications of add-in:

1. Switches between these formats for cells in the current active sheet when add-in run, i. e. MM/DD/YYYY and DD/MM/YYYY on each next click with a message box indicating change has been applied.
2. The algorithm can't distinguish between dates with where MM and YY are less than 13, thus any further clicks will toggle e.g. 05/10/YYYY and 10/05/YYYY back and forth.
3. It checks if the date to be formatted found in the current calendar of runtime, if not the change to be applied on the current cell will be skipped, e.g. if it's not a leap year, then the cell with date e.g. 02/29/YYYY will not be changed.
4. Any distinguishable date found in the current calendar during runtime e.g. 04/26/YYYY will be changed to 26/04/YYYY just once. (Any further clicks won't toggle it back)
